## Project Overview
<p align="justify"> A device made to help doctors diagnose patients with Parkinson's disease and follow-up on its progression. The idea is to test the stability of the patients hand as well as their hand-eye coordination by asking them to aim a laser pointer at the sensor for ten seconds.</p>

## Application Idea
<p align="justify"> Parkinson's Disease affects the nervous system and causes hand tremors. It's a progressive disease that can also affect hand-eye coordination as it progresses. While it cannot be cured, but medications can help control symptoms. Therefore, it's important to follow-up with the patient to avoid the need for surgery. This device is used to diagnose patients by asking them to aim a laser pointer at an LDR Sensor for ten seconds. If their hand is stable, they pass the test. However, if their hand shakes a lot and they fail to aim at the sensor, they fail the test and there's a high chance they have Parkinson's disease. </p>

## Parameters 
<p align="justify"> The light source used in the device is a laser pointer. Itâ€™s a small battery-operated device containing a laser diode that emits a very narrow coherent laser beam, making it a potent signaling tool. The coherence of the light beam is an important property for the accuracy of the device. The laser has an intensity of 5mW/mm2, has a spot size of 1mm2, and emits a beam of wavelength 473 nm. </p>
